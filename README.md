In the last couple of years, Next Best Action method has developed by leaps and bounds. It has already established its importance in increasing the productivity or demand in an Industry/Company. Apart from increasing supply, it is also used for customer analysis and customer behaviour.
Next Best Action (also known as best next action, next best activity or recommended action), is a customer-centric approach to marketing that considers multiple different actions that could be taken for a specific customer and then decides on the best one to provide. Moreover, Next Best Action commonly requires the need for automated self-learning decisions, using machine learning, to make a decision in real-time that will improve the chances of a conversion at the moment that a customer is making a purchase decision.
The Next Best Action (to deliver the relevant offer, proposition or service) is determined through a combination of the customerâ€™s interests as well as the objectives of the business. For example, as a marketing team your simple objective might be to sell a specific product or product range during an offer window, but must be balanced with how the customer likes to be contacted and the likelihood for them to have an interest in that product or product range. 


## Objective

Our Basic objective is to find Next Best Action so that individual customer most likely to move closer to purchase.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Next-best-action marketing (also known as best next action or next best activity or recommended action), as a special case of next-best-action decision-making, is a customer-centric marketing paradigm that considers the different actions that can be taken for a specific customer and decides on the â€˜bestâ€™ one.[1] The Next Best Action (an offer, proposition, service, etc.) is determined by the customer's interests and needs on the one hand, and the marketing organization's business objectives, policies on the other. This is in sharp contrast to traditional marketing approaches that first create a proposition for a product or service and then attempt to find interested and eligible prospects for that proposition.

* Number of contacts with the customer during the campaign is also very important. The number of contacts with the customer shouldn't exceed 4.

Part 2:
* Total sales is $119M. Total COGS is $ 101.83M.  
* Total Profit is $16.89M.
* Highest Number of Profit is from Country Germany.
* Highest Number of Products sold was from Toshiba Company.
* Highest Sales was in Month October 2014.  Highest Sales is from Government Segment.

Part 3:
* Most Frequent Items are :
 
(a)	Mineral Water
